# Meetup for WordPress

This plugin functions as a glue between the Meetup API and WordPress.

*Note: We will only be supporting this from 5.6+ as older versions of PHP experience too many security issues.*

## Dependencies

This plugin depends on the following:
* dms/meetup-api-client
* Min. PHP version: 5.6
